    <p>Rogerstown Estuary: Cloudy Water with characteristics of Hard water, Deposition of Sand and Marine Life HIGH.<br>Coast between Balbriggan and Skerries is exceptionally rocky in parts with a sandy beach section at Ardgillan. Towards the Town of Skerries parts of rock sticking out are quite highlighted in the coastline/seashore topography as there may be a fault line, the Rocks seems like shale or sandstone with Irish Sea basin origin (Source: GSI)<br>Rogerstown Estuary Update:Shoreline, tideline, and area closest to Human activity such as the grassland by the car park and erosion-protection boulders/rocks. The tide and sea also bring in rubbish and litter from a wider area on waves etc. so a wide range of materials are washed up on the beach e.g. Plastics etc. Rogerstown Estuary is a Special Area of Conservation and is protected by the EPA and the National Parks and Wildlife Service but has been in the media lately because of environmental concern. <br>•	The Ballealy Landfill was in commission until 2009 and efforts are still being made to stop Methane leakage into the surrounding water.<br>•	A Raw Sewage pipe at Tower Street removes sewage from the Town of Rush into the Sea but as of May 2017 construction is underway to divert this waste to a proper sewage treatment plant.<br>•	As the area has a high amount of Market Gardening use, there is much agricultural Run-Off from farming pesticides that enter our waterways through smaller tributary streams in the catchment area.</p>
